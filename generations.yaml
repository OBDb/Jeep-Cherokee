generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SJ)"
    start_year: 1974
    end_year: 1983
    description: "The original Cherokee was a two-door variant of the full-size Jeep Wagoneer, effectively a sportier version of the larger SUV. Built on a traditional body-on-frame truck platform with solid axles front and rear, it featured rugged construction and legitimate off-road capability. Powered by a range of inline-six and V8 engines including AMC's 258 cubic-inch six-cylinder and various 360 cubic-inch V8s, it balanced power with the durability expected of a Jeep. The interior was relatively sparse by modern standards but functional, with available amenities including air conditioning and upgraded upholstery. This generation established the Cherokee nameplate that would eventually become one of Jeep's most recognizable models, though it was considerably larger and more truck-like than later generations."

  - name: "Second Generation (XJ)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The XJ Cherokee represented a revolutionary approach to SUV design, combining traditional Jeep capability with more modern unibody construction instead of the previous body-on-frame approach. Significantly smaller and lighter than its predecessor, it featured boxy, upright styling that would become iconic. Initially available with either AMC's 2.5L four-cylinder or 2.8L V6 (later replaced by a 4.0L inline-six), it offered a choice of manual or automatic transmissions and various four-wheel drive systems including Command-Trac and Selec-Trac. The interior was practical and durable rather than luxurious, with adequate space for five passengers. Through its remarkably long production run, the XJ Cherokee received various updates to styling, powertrains, and features, but maintained its fundamental character. This generation became a benchmark for compact SUVs, combining everyday practicality with genuine off-road capability in a way few competitors could match. Its influential design and engineering approach essentially created the modern SUV segment, and its reputation for ruggedness and reliability has made it a cult classic among off-road enthusiasts."

  - name: "Third Generation (KJ, Liberty in North America)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The third-generation Cherokee was marketed as the Liberty in North America while retaining the Cherokee name in most international markets. Featuring more rounded styling than its predecessor, it maintained traditional Jeep design elements like the seven-slot grille and trapezoidal wheel arches. Built on a new platform with rack-and-pinion steering and an independent front suspension (with solid rear axle), it attempted to balance on-road comfort with off-road capability. Powertrain options included a 2.4L four-cylinder, 3.7L V6, and in some markets, diesel engines, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior offered more modern amenities and improved materials compared to the utilitarian XJ. This generation represented a more mainstream approach to the compact SUV segment, though some enthusiasts criticized it for sacrificing some of the rugged simplicity that had defined the XJ. Despite these criticisms, it maintained respectable off-road capability with available four-wheel drive systems including Command-Trac and Selec-Trac."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (KK, Liberty in North America)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The fourth-generation Cherokee (still called Liberty in North America) featured more angular styling that referenced classic Jeep design cues, with a boxier silhouette than its predecessor. Built on an updated platform, it maintained the independent front suspension/solid rear axle layout. Power came primarily from a 3.7L V6 engine in North America, with various four-cylinder and diesel options in international markets. The interior saw improvements in design and material quality, though still focused more on durability than luxury. Notable features included the Sky Slider full-length canvas roof option and an available MyGIG infotainment system. This generation continued Jeep's effort to balance daily usability with off-road capability, offering systems like Command-Trac II four-wheel drive and an available Trail Rated package. Production ended in 2012 as Jeep prepared to reintroduce the Cherokee name in North America with a completely redesigned vehicle."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (KL)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The KL Cherokee marked a dramatic departure from previous generations, featuring polarizing styling with split headlights, a curved interpretation of the seven-slot grille, and more car-like proportions. Built on the Compact US Wide platform shared with various Fiat Chrysler products, it used a fully independent suspension for improved on-road manners. Powertrain options evolved throughout its production, initially including a 2.4L four-cylinder and 3.2L V6, later adding a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder, paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Available in front-wheel drive or with various four-wheel drive systems including the advanced Active Drive Lock with a rear locking differential on Trailhawk models. The interior offered significantly improved design, materials, and technology, featuring Uconnect infotainment systems and modern safety features. A substantial refresh in 2019 unified the headlights for a more conventional appearance and updated technology features. Despite its controversial styling and more road-focused platform, the Trailhawk variant maintained Jeep's off-road credibility with impressive capability for a unibody crossover. Production ended in 2023 as part of Stellantis' product portfolio realignment, with the Compass expanding to fill part of the Cherokee's former position in the lineup."
